Changes since version 1.0 - bbxwg <add:The start of the FlowMaster>:

    -For the convenience of the user experience, 
    -only a single IP rate limit is currently supported because TCS are limited by ids. 
    -Later, you can let the user configure the ID when entering or record the ID in the configuration file.
